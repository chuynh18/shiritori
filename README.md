=========

A [Japanese rhyming game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori).  This is just a proof-of-concept and is missing a lot of required features.

Limitations
-----------

As mentioned, this is simply a proof-of-concept.  Known limitations are:
* Does not actually know what words are actual Japanese words
* Text entry box is not restricted to only Japanese characters
* No katakana support
* Not awfully friendly for mobile devices

Of course, there may be bugs!
