=========

A [Japanese rhyming game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori).  This is just a proof-of-concept and is missing a lot of required features.

Features
--------
* A very limited Japanese dictionary.  If the game recognizes the word you've used, it will show the meaning of that word in English.
* Automatically romanizes Hiragana and Katakana.  Handles [Sokuon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon) and (for Katakana) [Ch≈çonpu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Donpu).
* Highlights the phonemes that must match (last phoneme of leading word, first phoneme of following word).
* Simple transition animations to help make the flow of the game more obvious.
* The page should display just fine on mobile devices.

Limitations
-----------

As mentioned, this is simply a proof-of-concept.  Known limitations are:
* Does not actually know what words are actual Japanese words
    * So it won't limit you to just nouns (but of course...  it can't distinguish between real words and gibberish)
* Text entry box is not restricted to only Japanese characters
  
Of course, there may be bugs!
